# Class 43 Example

### How to create a good game : 

- Subway Surfers
  - **PC** --> Your character that you can choose
  - **NPC** --> Policeman and dog chasing you, trains (had sound effects), tracks, bushes, obstacles.
  - **Goal** --> How much time and distance you can go without being caught
  - **Rules** --> Playing space, can't jump onto trains from ground, can't be hit by obstacles
  - **Balance** --> Power ups (make you faster, jump higher, get on a skateboard)
  - **Adaptivity** --> NPC's become faster and you start going faster with them
  - **Chance** --> Random power ups could be easy to get, you could randomly end up on a path with no obstacles
  - **Skill** --> Getting as many power ups, picking right paths that are easier, being dodgy
  - **Feedback** --> Score, policeman can be right behind you if you mess up, if you're doing good policeman is far behind
  - **Game Story** (*Defined*) --> Your character (PC) is vandalizing train with spray paint and gets spotted by policeman. Policeman and policeman's dog start chaisng PC and PC has to escape.
